# IoMBian Discover

![iombian-discover builder](https://github.com/Tknika/iombian-discover/workflows/iombian-discover%20builder/badge.svg)

This is a companion app for the [IoMBian project](https://github.com/Tknika/iombian), aimed to help discovering IoMBian devices available in the local network.

## Installation

The application does not need to be installed, because it is released as a single executable file for the three main operating systems: Windows, macOS and Linux.
New releases are published in the [Release](https://github.com/Tknika/iombian-discover/releases) section of the GitHub repository:

![Release](./docs/release-assets.png "Release")

Download the file that corresponds to your OS and launch it (usually a double click in the icon is enough).
If the application does not start, ensure that the file has execution permissions.
